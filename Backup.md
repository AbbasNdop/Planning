 Backup and Disaster Recovery Steps

Here's how I'll go about scheduling regular backups and creating disaster recovery plans for the VM:

 1. Schedule Regular Backups
- Purpose: Ensure data is regularly backed up to prevent data loss.
- Steps:
  1. Enable Azure Backup:
     - Go to the Azure portal.
     - Navigate to the VM I have created to back up.
     - In the VM's menu, select "Backup."
     - Click "Enable Backup" and configure the backup policy (e.g., daily, weekly) For this project, I used daily backup.
  2. Configure Backup Policy:
     - Define the backup frequency (e.g., daily at 2 AM).
     - Set the retention period (e.g., keep daily backups for 30 days).
     - Save the policy and apply it to the VM.
  3. Monitor Backups:
     - Use Azure Backup reports to monitor the status of backups.
     - Set up alerts for backup failures or issues.

 2. Create a Disaster Recovery Plan
- Purpose: Ensure quick recovery in case of a disaster.
- Steps:
  1. Enable Azure Site Recovery:
     - Go to the Azure portal.
     - Navigate to "Site Recovery" under "Recovery Services."
     - Click "Enable Site Recovery" and select the VM created.
  2. Configure Replication:
     - Choose the target region for replication.
     - Set up the replication policy (e.g., continuous replication).
     - Start the replication process.
  3. Test Failover:
     - Perform a test failover to ensure the VM can be recovered in the target region.
     - Validate that the VM and applications are functioning correctly after failover.
  4. Document Recovery Procedures:
     - Create a detailed recovery plan document.
     - Include steps for initiating failover, verifying recovery, and switching back to the primary region.
  5. Regularly Review and Update:
     - Periodically review the disaster recovery plan.
     - Update the plan as needed based on changes to the infrastructure or business requirements.
