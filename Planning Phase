Planning Phase

The planning phase involves gathering and preparing the necessary resources for the project. Key steps include:

A. Network Infrastructure Setup:
   - Create a Virtual Network (VNet) and subnet  
   - Set up Firewall and Application Gateway (Layer 7) for traffic management  
   - Configure a Network Security Group (NSG) for the subnet to control inbound and outbound traffic  
   - Use CIDR to determine the VNet size  
   - Create a Resource Group to organize related resources  

B. Network Configuration Confirmation:  
   - Confirm network settings with the developer, focusing on **inbound** and outbound traffic requirements

C. Resource Cost Estimation:  
   - Estimate resource costs and ensure they stay within the project's budget

D. Topology Design:  
   - Create a network topology diagram for better visualization and plannin
