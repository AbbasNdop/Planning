VM Spin-up in AZ Environment

I am a Microsoft Azure and Office 365 System Administrator, responsible for managing cloud infrastructure, setting up virtual machines, and providing technical support for developers and other system admins. My role also involves ensuring security compliance and maintaining system efficiency. I typically handle requests through a ticketing system, reviewing each one to ensure all requirements are clear before proceeding.

For this project, I'll guide you through my process of setting up a VM based on a developer's request, which includes the following specifications:

- OS: Windows Server 2019  
- Database: PostgreSQL  
- Storage: 250 GB minimum  
- Memory: 8 GB RAM  
- Network: Open ports for HTTP/HTTPS (80, 443) and port 1433  
- Access: RDP with secure credentials  
- Security: Whitelist access, firewall rules, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for secure access  

In addition to setting up the VM, I ensure the following:

- Data encryption in transit, at rest, and during use  
- Regular automated backups for disaster recovery  
- OS and application patches and updates  
- Monitoring system performance, logs, and security events  
- Configuring alerts for system or security issues  
- Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) for enhanced security

My process follows four key phases:

1. Planning: Define project scope, gather requirements, and ensure resource availability.  
2. Implementation: Set up the VM, install necessary software, configure networking, and apply security settings.  
3. Post-Deployment: Conduct testing, validate system performance, and ensure security policies are applied.  
4. Backup: Schedule regular backups and create disaster recovery plans.

Each phase is documented in separate folders. Feel free to review and leave any comments!
