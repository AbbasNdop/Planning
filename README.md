# Planning

I received a request from one of our developers to set up a VM for a new project with the following requirements:

- OS: Windows Server 2019  
- Database: PostgreSQL  
- Storage: Minimum 250 GB  
- Memory: 8 GB RAM  
- Network: Open HTTP/HTTPS (ports 80, 443) and port 1433  
- Access: Initial RDP access with secure credentials  
- Security: Implement a whitelist for access and ensure proper firewall rules

In addition to configuring the VM and securing it, I will also:

- Ensure data encryption in transit, in use and at rest  
- Set up regular backups for the database  
- Apply necessary patches and updates for OS and software  
- Monitor performance and logs for any security or performance issues

I'll guide you through my 4-phase process for setting up the VM:  
1. Planning 
2. Implementation  
3. Post-Deployment 
4. Backup
