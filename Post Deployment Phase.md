 Post-Deployment Steps

After deploying the VM and network infrastructure, here's how I'll ensure everything is running smoothly and securely:

 1. Conduct Testing
- Purpose: Verify that the VM and network components are functioning as expected.
- Steps:
  1. Connectivity Tests: Check if the VM can be accessed via RDP/SSH using Azure Bastion.
  2. Application Tests: Ensure that any applications or services running on the VM are accessible and performing correctly.
  3. Network Tests: Validate that the firewall and NSG rules are correctly allowing and blocking traffic as intended.

2. Validate System Performance
- Purpose: Ensure the VM meets performance expectations.
- Steps:
  1. Monitor Resource Usage: Use Azure Monitor to track CPU, memory, and disk usage.
  2. Performance Benchmarks: Run performance benchmarks to compare against expected metrics.
  3. Adjust Resources: If necessary, adjust VM size or resources to optimize performance.

 3. Ensure Security Policies are Applied
- Purpose: Confirm that all security measures are in place and effective.
- Steps:
  1. Review Security Rules: Double-check NSG and firewall rules to ensure they match the security requirements.
  2. Enable Threat Protection: Use Azure Security Center to enable threat protection and monitor for vulnerabilities.
  3. Audit Logs: Set up logging and auditing to track access and changes to the VM and network.
